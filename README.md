# A.T.L.A.S.
### Autonomous Task and Local AI System

A fully local, voice-controlled AI assistant for Linux — inspired by the AI assistants 
of science fiction, built for the real world. Runs completely on your own hardware with 
no data leaving your machine by default. Optionally connects to Claude and Gemini APIs 
for long-context reasoning and real-time information — always with your explicit permission.

---

## Why Atlas?

Most voice assistants send your data to the cloud. Atlas runs entirely 
on your hardware — your conversations, your files, your code never leave 
your machine. Cloud models are available but always opt-in and always 
announced before use.

Atlas can answer questions, tell jokes, and hold a conversation.
Atlas can open applications, control your browser, search the web, and navigate pages.
Atlas can create files and folders, and generate code in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and more.
Atlas can read files, run scripts, and manage your workspace.
Atlas also has vision through your webcam — able to see what’s in front of it, identify objects,
read text, and answer questions about what it sees. Atlas has access to Gemini for real-time information
and Claude for long document analysis. It can also check and manage your calendar. You can even use Atlas
on the go with your Android device!

---

## GUI

The GUI is a PyQt5 window with a vispy 3D particle orb embedded above a control panel.

### Orb States
| State | Color | Animation |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Listening | Blue | Slow gentle pulse |
| Thinking | Green | Medium pulse, more particles |
| Speaking | Light blue | Fast pulse |
| Sleeping | Yellow | Very slow deep breath, sparse particles |
| Error | Red | Rapid jitter |

The orb features per-particle color variation, depth-based size variation, and beam line connections between nearby particles for a holographic look. Each state has distinct particle density, breathing speed, and connection density.

</div>


> Orb particle colors are defined in `face.py` `COLORS` dict. 
> GUI chrome colors are configurable via `config.yaml` under the `gui` section.

### Caption Area
Displays real-time status as Atlas works:
```
Classifying...
Planning...
Step 1 of 3: create_dir...
Step 2 of 3: generate_code...
Waiting for confirmation...
Done, code written to: workspace/project/file.js
```
Shows spoken text when Atlas is speaking, clears automatically after.

## Overview

Atlas is built around a layered intelligence architecture:

1. **Fast keyword layer** — instant response for known commands (open apps, wake words, pause)
2. **phi3:mini** — handles simple conversational questions directly, escalates everything else
3. **Mistral 7B** — orchestrates complex multi-step tasks and generates structured execution plans
4. **DeepSeek Coder 6.7B** — dedicated code generation model, handles all code files
5. **Cloud APIs** — Claude and Gemini available for long-context reasoning and real-time information (opt-in, permission required)
6. **LLaVA** — local vision model, analyzes webcam frames for object identification, 
   scene description, and text reading
7. **MemPalace** - controlled memory recall and formatting pipeline

All core functionality runs **completely locally** on your machine. No data leaves your computer unless you explicitly approve it.

- **stt/hybrid_stt.py** — Speech-to-text (Whisper + Faster-Whisper).

---

### 👁️ Vision System

- **eyes.py** — Webcam + screen vision using LLaVA.
- **eyes_handler.py** — Converts user commands into vision actions.
- **screenshots/** — Stores captured images for analysis (created at runtime).

---

### 📬 Integrations

- **gmail/**  
  - `gmail_module.py` — Authentication + core Gmail operations  
  - `email_monitor.py` — Watches inbox for important messages  
  - `email_drafter.py` — Generates replies using LLMs  

- **calendar_module.py** — Google Calendar integration  
- **calendar_handler.py** — Parses user commands into calendar actions  

---

### 🌐 Automation

- **window_controller.py** — Controls and navigates desktop applications  
- **app_launcher.py** — Fast keyword-based app launching  
- **tool_executor.py** — Executes generated plans (files, scripts, tasks)

---

### 📁 Workspaces & Data

- **workspace/** — User-controlled file operations (gitignored)  
- **notes/** — Development notes, planned features, known issues  
- **tests/** — Test scripts and experimental components  

---

### 🔐 Configuration

- **config/api_keys.py** — Secure API key storage via OS keyring  

---

## Notes

- Some directories (e.g., `workspace/`, `screenshots/`) are created automatically on first use.
- Screenshot storage may grow over time — users are notified when it becomes large.
- Sensitive data (API keys, config) is never stored directly in the repository.

---

## Platform Support

| Feature | Linux | Mac | Windows |
|---------|-------|-----|---------|
| Core AI/LLM | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Voice I/O | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| File/code tools | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| App launching | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Browser control | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| GUI | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

⚠️ = works with minor path configuration

**Mac:** App paths in `app_launcher.py` are Linux paths — update to `/Applications/...` style. Replace `xdg-open` with `open`.

**Windows:** Not recommended — use a VM instead. `xdg-open` doesn't exist, all app paths break, PyAudio installation is painful.

---

## System Requirements

- Linux (tested on Pop!_OS with COSMIC desktop)
- Python 3.11+
- 16GB RAM minimum
- GPU optional (NVIDIA recommended) — falls back to CPU automatically
- Microphone (headset strongly recommended — internal mics pick up background noise)
- Speakers or headphones

---

## Running Atlas

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

Atlas will calibrate the microphone noise floor, open the GUI, then say **"Hello sir, what can I do for you"** when ready.

### Calendar/Gmail Setup
Atlas uses Google Calendar/Gmail API with OAuth2. On first use a browser window will open for Google login. Approve access and the token is saved permanently — never asked again.

Credentials and token are stored outside the project:
```
~/.config/atlas/google_calendar_credentials.json  ← download from Google Cloud Console
~/.config/atlas/google_calendar_token.json        ← created automatically on first login
```

---

## Remote Access (SSH)

Atlas runs headlessly over SSH — control it from your Android phone, tablet, or any terminal.
```bash
python main.py --no-gui
```

### Features
- Clean `>>` text prompt — Atlas output never interrupts your typing
- Voice still active via desktop mic and speakers
- State and captions printed to terminal instead of GUI
- PyQt5 not imported — no display required
- Type `exit`, `quit`, or `q` to stop

---

### Android Setup

**Step 1 — Install Termux**
Install from **F-Droid** (not Play Store — Play Store version is outdated):
https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/

**Step 2 — Install Tailscale (access from anywhere)**

On your desktop:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up
tailscale ip  # note this IP
```

On your phone: install **Tailscale** from Play Store and sign in with the same account.

Tailscale creates a private encrypted tunnel — works over WiFi, cellular, anywhere.

**Step 3 — Set up one-command access**

In Termux:
```bash
pkg update && pkg install openssh tmux

# create alias
echo "alias atlas='ssh your_username@your_tailscale_ip'" >> ~/.bashrc

# auto-load on Termux startup
echo ". ~/.bashrc" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

On your desktop, add to `~/.bashrc` so Atlas starts automatically on SSH connect:
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```
Add at the bottom:
```bash
if [ -n "$SSH_CONNECTION" ]; then
    cd ~/dev/A.T.L.A.S.
    source .venv/bin/activate
    exec python main.py --no-gui
fi
```

**Step 4 — Connect**

Just type in Termux:
```bash
atlas
```

Atlas connects and starts automatically. Every time.

---

### Keep Atlas Running After Closing Termux (tmux)

By default Atlas stops when you close Termux. To keep it running in the background:
```bash
# on desktop, start Atlas in a tmux session:
tmux new -s atlas
python main.py --no-gui

# detach without stopping — Ctrl+B then D
# reconnect later:
tmux attach -t atlas
```

With tmux Atlas runs permanently on your desktop — reconnect from your phone anytime and pick up where you left off.

---

### Text Input Example
```
>> what do I have today
[Atlas] Massage at 2:30 PM, sir.

>> create a flask app
[Atlas] classifying...
[Atlas] Creating Flask app with common endpoints.
[Atlas] Building it now, sir.
[Atlas] Done, sir. Code written to workspace/flask_app.py

>> exit
[Atlas] Goodbye, sir.
```

> **Note:** `exit` stops Atlas. To disconnect without stopping Atlas, detach from tmux with `Ctrl+B D`.

---

## Running Atlas on Android (Standalone)

Atlas can run directly on Android using proot-distro — no desktop required for basic functionality. phi3 handles fast Q&A locally on device, with optional fallback to desktop for heavy tasks.

> **Tested on:** Samsung Galaxy S10+ (8GB RAM, Snapdragon 855, ARM64)

---

### What Works on Android
```
phi3:mini local inference  ✅  ~5 second responses
Text input via >> prompt   ✅
Calendar integration       ✅
Gmail integration       ✅
Gemini API                 ✅
Brain/LLM routing          ✅
Voice input/output         ❌  use_mock: true (text only)
GUI orb                    ❌  --no-gui mode
```

---

### Prerequisites
- Termux installed from **F-Droid** (not Play Store)
- At least 6GB free storage
- 6GB+ RAM recommended (8GB ideal)
- WiFi recommended for initial setup

---

### Step 1 — Install proot-distro
```bash
# in Termux
pkg update && pkg install proot-distro git wget -y
proot-distro install ubuntu
proot-distro login ubuntu
```

---

### Step 2 — Install system dependencies
```bash
# inside Ubuntu proot
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip git wget \
  portaudio19-dev python3-dev libasound2-dev \
  libopenblas-dev software-properties-common -y
```

---

### Step 3 — Install Ollama
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# start Ollama in background
ollama serve &

# wait a few seconds then pull phi3
ollama pull phi3:mini
```

> **Note:** `ollama serve` may appear to hang — it's running in background. If you see "address already in use" it's already started successfully.

---

### Step 4 — Clone Atlas
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/sdoylelambda/A.T.L.A.S.git
cd A.T.L.A.S
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

---

### Step 5 — Install Python dependencies
```bash
pip install pyyaml ollama anthropic google-genai \
  prompt-toolkit requests numpy openai-whisper \
  faster-whisper simpleaudio piper-tts playwright \
  keyring google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client \
  opencv-python-headless
```

> **Note:** PyAudio may fail on ARM — skip it, audio is mocked on Android.
> faiss-cpu is optional — skip if it fails, only needed for RAG/memory.

---

### Step 6 — Download voice model
```bash
mkdir -p modules/voices
cd modules/voices
wget https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/resolve/main/en/en_GB/alan/medium/en_GB-alan-medium.onnx
wget https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/resolve/main/en/en_GB/alan/medium/en_GB-alan-medium.onnx.json
mv en_GB-alan-medium.onnx british_man_GB-alan-medium.onnx
mv en_GB-alan-medium.onnx.json british_man_GB-alan-medium.onnx.json
cd ~/A.T.L.A.S
```

---

### Step 7 — Configure for Android
```yaml
# config.yaml
audio:
  use_mock: true   # disables mic/speakers — use text input instead

system:
  use_gpu: false   # no GPU in proot environment
```

---

### Step 8 — Run Atlas
```bash
ollama serve &
python3 main.py --no-gui
```

---

### Returning to Atlas
Everything persists between sessions. To resume:
```bash
# in Termux
proot-distro login ubuntu
cd ~/A.T.L.A.S
source .venv/bin/activate
ollama serve &
python3 main.py --no-gui
```

Add a shortcut alias in Ubuntu's `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
echo "alias atlas='cd ~/A.T.L.A.S && source .venv/bin/activate && ollama serve & && sleep 2 && python3 main.py --no-gui'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Then just type `atlas` to start.

---

### Memory Considerations
```
phi3:mini needs ~3.5GB RAM
Close all other apps before running
If "requires more system memory" error:
  → close all background apps
  → try again
  → phi3 needs ~3.5GB free
```

---

### Architecture: Android Standalone vs SSH
```
Android Standalone (this guide):
  Phone runs phi3 locally
  No desktop needed for basic commands
  Text only — no voice
  
SSH to Desktop (see Remote Access section):
  All processing on desktop GPU
  Much faster responses
  Voice works via desktop mic/speakers
  Requires desktop to be on
```

For best results — use SSH for voice commands at home, standalone for text commands anywhere.

---

### Future: Phone as Full Interface

With phone mic, speakers, and camera integrated, the GUI becomes optional:
```
Phone mic    → wake word + voice commands
Desktop GPU  → all AI processing
Phone speaker → spoken responses
Phone camera → vision and object recognition
```

An always-on AI assistant accessible from anywhere — no screen required.
See roadmap: FastAPI server → Flutter mobile app.

---

### GUI Customization for Desktop

Atlas's name and all GUI colors are configurable in `config.yaml` — no code changes needed.
```yaml
personalize:
  ai_assistant_name: "A.T.L.A.S."
gui:
  border_color: "#1a6aff"      # window border color
  border_width: 2              # border thickness in pixels
  background_color: "#0a0a0f"  # main background
  text_color: "#c8d8e8"        # primary text
  caption_color: "#8a9ab8"     # caption/status text
  heard_color: "#4499ff"       # "heard" transcription label
  button_bg: "#1a1a2e"         # button background
  button_border: "#2a2a4e"     # button border
  button_hover: "#2a2a4e"      # button hover background
```

### Notes
- Title bar color is controlled by your desktop compositor (COSMIC, GNOME, etc.) — not configurable via Qt on Wayland
- Canvas background updates automatically from `background_color`
- Restart Atlas after changing colors
- Window positioning and always-on-top not supported under Wayland by design
- On COSMIC desktop: right-click titlebar → Sticky to pin above other windows
- On X11: window position saves automatically every 5 seconds and restores on next launch

## Architecture: How a Command Flows

```
Your voice
↓
Whisper STT — transcribes audio to text
↓
Hallucination filter — drops repetitive/too-short/echo audio
↓
Fast keyword layer (AppLauncher)
├── matched → execute instantly (open app, wake, pause, cancel)
└── no match ↓
Command Queue — voice keeps listening while Brain processes
↓
Memory Recall Pipeline (MemPalace)
├── Semantic recall (similarity search on query)
├── Returns relevant past memories (if any)
└── Injects context into Brain
↓
phi3:mini classifier
├── simple fact/conversation → answer directly (~2-4 seconds)
└── ESCALATE ↓
Mistral orchestrator
├── generates JSON execution plan (dynamic ctx: 1024–8192)
├── speaks summary → "Shall I proceed, sir?"
├── waits for voice confirmation
└── confirmed ↓
ToolExecutor
```

---

## Command Queue

Atlas processes commands concurrently — voice keeps listening while Brain is working. Say a second command while Atlas is executing the first and it will be queued and processed immediately after.

```
"create a flask app"  →  Brain starts working
"what's 5 times 5"   →  queued while Brain works
                         answered immediately after first command finishes
```

Commands are processed one at a time in order — no commands are dropped.

---

## Dynamic Context Windows

Mistral's context window scales automatically based on command complexity:

| Command Type | ctx | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Simple (≤10 words) | 1024 | "create a file called hello.txt" |
| Medium (≤20 words) | 2048 | "create a folder called projects" |
| Code task (≤15 words) | 4096 | "create a flask file with routes" |
| Complex code (>15 words) | 8192 | "create a flask backend with auth and database models" |
| Complex multi-step | 4096 | long commands with and/then/also |

---

## Noise Floor Calibration

Atlas automatically calibrates microphone thresholds at startup and every 20 seconds:

- Uses the **95th percentile** of samples — handles AC/fan spikes better than mean
- Dynamically sets `start_threshold` and `stop_threshold` based on your environment
- Prints results: `[Ears] Noise floor=1842 start=7368 stop=3684`
- Warns if noise floor exceeds 5000 RMS and uses conservative static thresholds
- Stream lock prevents concurrent calibration and listening from causing ALSA crashes

**Tip:** A headset or USB microphone dramatically improves accuracy in noisy environments.

---

## Plan → Confirm → Execute

For any command that involves executing steps, Atlas will:

1. **Speak the plan** — "Creating flask folder with backend.py inside."
2. **Ask for confirmation** — "Shall I proceed, sir?"
3. **Wait for your response** — say yes/yeah/do it/go ahead to confirm, anything else cancels
4. **Execute** — runs each step, updates GUI caption with live progress, checks for cancel between steps
5. **Report** — "Done, sir. Code written to workspace/backend.py"

**File exists?** Atlas says "backend.py already exists, sir. Say overwrite to replace it." Say overwrite/replace/yes to proceed or anything else to keep the existing file.

**Slow response?** If Brain takes more than 5 seconds, Atlas says "One moment please, sir." and continues working.

## Troubleshooting

**Atlas mishears commands**
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- For file extensions say "dot p y" not "dot py"
- Consider upgrading Whisper model from `small` to `medium` in config
- A headset mic dramatically reduces background noise issues

**"Max speech duration reached" constantly firing**
- Background noise exceeds your start threshold
- Check `[Ears] Noise floor=...` in logs — if above 5000, environment is very noisy
- Increase `start_multiplier` in config (default 4.0, try 5.0 or 6.0)
- A headset mic is the most reliable fix

**ALSA/SIGABRT/SIGSEGV crashes**
- Stream accessed concurrently — ensure `_stream_lock` is in place in ears.py
- Disable `auto_calibrate` temporarily to confirm it's the source
- Restart audio: `systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber`

**Mic not found after audio crash**
- Run: `systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber`
- ears.py falls back to `pulse` device automatically if analog mic isn't found

**Response is very slow**
- Expected on CPU — 7B models take 20-30 seconds without GPU
- Simple questions via phi3 should be 2-4 seconds
- Code generation via DeepSeek takes 30-90 seconds on CPU
- GPU upgrade (sm_61+) is the most impactful hardware improvement

**phi3 trying to handle computer tasks itself**
- ESCALATE keyword triggers fallthrough to Mistral
- Code block detector in `quick_answer()` catches most cases
- Add examples to phi3 system prompt for edge cases

**File created with explanation text instead of code**
- DeepSeek added commentary — the stripper handles this automatically
- Explanation lines are commented out at bottom of file, not deleted
- Check `[ToolExecutor] ⚠️ Stripped N lines` in logs

**Mistral returning truncated JSON**
- Dynamic ctx sizing handles this automatically
- Check `[Brain] num_ctx:` log line
- If still occurring, increase manually in config

**"Shall I proceed" confirmation not heard**
- Ears resumes after TTS — speak clearly after Atlas finishes asking
- If misheard, it will cancel — just repeat the command or type yes in text box and click send

**GUI window position not saving**
- Position save/restore only works on X11 — not supported under Wayland by design
- On COSMIC desktop: right-click titlebar → Sticky to pin the window

**GUI loads in the middle of the screen**
- Expected on Wayland — compositor controls window placement
- Drag to preferred position and use compositor sticky/pin feature
