# A.T.L.A.S.
### Autonomous Task and Local AI System

A fully local, voice-controlled AI assistant for Linux — inspired by the AI assistants 
of science fiction, built for the real world. Runs completely on your own hardware with 
no data leaving your machine by default. Optionally connects to Claude and Gemini APIs 
for long-context reasoning and real-time information — always with your explicit permission.

---

## Why Atlas?

Most voice assistants send your data to the cloud. Atlas runs entirely 
on your hardware — your conversations, your files, your code never leave 
your machine. Cloud models are available but always opt-in and always 
announced before use.

---

## GUI

The GUI is a PyQt5 window with a vispy 3D particle orb embedded above a control panel.

### Orb States
| State | Color | Animation |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Listening | Blue | Slow gentle pulse |
| Thinking | Green | Medium pulse, more particles |
| Speaking | Light blue | Fast pulse |
| Sleeping | Yellow | Very slow deep breath, sparse particles |
| Error | Red | Rapid jitter |

The orb features per-particle color variation, depth-based size variation, and beam line connections between nearby particles for a holographic look. Each state has distinct particle density, breathing speed, and connection density.

> Orb particle colors are defined in `face.py` `COLORS` dict. 
> GUI chrome colors are configurable via `config.yaml` under the `gui` section.

### Caption Area
Displays real-time status as Atlas works:
```
Classifying...
Planning...
Step 1 of 3: create_dir...
Step 2 of 3: generate_code...
Waiting for confirmation...
Done, code written to: workspace/project/file.js
```
Shows spoken text when Atlas is speaking, clears automatically after.

## Overview

Atlas is built around a layered intelligence architecture:

1. **Fast keyword layer** — instant response for known commands (open apps, wake words, pause)
2. **phi3:mini** — handles simple conversational questions directly, escalates everything else
3. **Mistral 7B** — orchestrates complex multi-step tasks and generates structured execution plans
4. **DeepSeek Coder 6.7B** — dedicated code generation model, handles all code files
5. **Cloud APIs** — Claude and Gemini available for long-context reasoning and real-time information (opt-in, permission required)
6. **LLaVA** — local vision model, analyzes webcam frames for object identification, 
   scene description, and text reading

All core functionality runs **completely locally** on your machine. No data leaves your computer unless you explicitly approve it.

## Platform Support

| Feature | Linux | Mac | Windows |
|---------|-------|-----|---------|
| Core AI/LLM | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Voice I/O | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| File/code tools | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| App launching | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Browser control | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| GUI | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

⚠️ = works with minor path configuration

**Mac:** App paths in `app_launcher.py` are Linux paths — update to `/Applications/...` style. Replace `xdg-open` with `open`.

**Windows:** Not recommended — use a VM instead. `xdg-open` doesn't exist, all app paths break, PyAudio installation is painful.

---

## System Requirements

- Linux (tested on Pop!_OS with COSMIC desktop)
- Python 3.11+
- 16GB RAM minimum
- GPU optional (NVIDIA recommended) — falls back to CPU automatically
- Microphone (headset strongly recommended — internal mics pick up background noise)
- Speakers or headphones

---

## Running Atlas

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

Atlas will calibrate the microphone noise floor, open the GUI, then say **"Hello sir, what can I do for you"** when ready.

### Calendar Setup
Atlas uses Google Calendar API with OAuth2. On first use a browser window will open for Google login. Approve access and the token is saved permanently — never asked again.

Credentials and token are stored outside the project:
```
~/.config/atlas/google_calendar_credentials.json  ← download from Google Cloud Console
~/.config/atlas/google_calendar_token.json        ← created automatically on first login
```

### Vision (Eyes)
| Say | Result |
|-----|--------|
| `what do you see` | Describes full scene |
| `what can you see` | Describes full scene |
| `what's on my desk` | Describes workspace |
| `what's behind me` | Describes background |
| `what am I holding` | Identifies object |
| `what is this` | Identifies object |
| `read this` | Transcribes visible text |
| `what does this say` | Transcribes visible text |
| `read the text on screen` | Reads monitor/screen text |
| `is anyone there` | Detects people in frame |
| `how many people` | Counts visible people |
| `what am I doing` | Describes activity |
| `what color is this` | Identifies colors |
| `do you see a phone` | Answers yes/no vision questions |
| `is there a X` | Answers yes/no vision questions |
| `does this look right` | General vision question |

### Vision Setup
Atlas uses your webcam and LLaVA running locally via Ollama.
```bash
ollama pull llava
pip install opencv-python
```

### GUI Customization

Atlas's name and all GUI colors are configurable in `config.yaml` — no code changes needed.
```yaml
personalize:
  ai_assistant_name: "A.T.L.A.S."
gui:
  border_color: "#1a6aff"      # window border color
  border_width: 2              # border thickness in pixels
  background_color: "#0a0a0f"  # main background
  text_color: "#c8d8e8"        # primary text
  caption_color: "#8a9ab8"     # caption/status text
  heard_color: "#4499ff"       # "heard" transcription label
  button_bg: "#1a1a2e"         # button background
  button_border: "#2a2a4e"     # button border
  button_hover: "#2a2a4e"      # button hover background
```

### Notes
- Title bar color is controlled by your desktop compositor (COSMIC, GNOME, etc.) — not configurable via Qt on Wayland
- Canvas background updates automatically from `background_color`
- Restart Atlas after changing colors
- Window positioning and always-on-top not supported under Wayland by design
- On COSMIC desktop: right-click titlebar → Sticky to pin above other windows
- On X11: window position saves automatically every 5 seconds and restores on next launch

## Architecture: How a Command Flows

```
Your voice
    ↓
Whisper STT — transcribes audio to text
    ↓
Hallucination filter — drops repetitive/too-short/echo audio
    ↓
Fast keyword layer (AppLauncher)
    ├── matched → execute instantly (open app, wake, pause, cancel)
    └── no match ↓
Command Queue — voice keeps listening while Brain processes
    ↓
phi3:mini classifier
    ├── simple fact/conversation → answer directly (~2-4 seconds)
    └── ESCALATE ↓
Mistral orchestrator
    ├── generates JSON execution plan (dynamic ctx: 1024–8192)
    ├── speaks summary → "Shall I proceed, sir?"
    ├── waits for voice confirmation
    └── confirmed ↓
ToolExecutor
    ├── create_file, create_dir
    ├── generate_code → DeepSeek Coder writes actual code
    ├── read_file, run_script, list_dir, delete_file
    └── web_search, browser_navigate, browser_search
```

---

## Command Queue

Atlas processes commands concurrently — voice keeps listening while Brain is working. Say a second command while Atlas is executing the first and it will be queued and processed immediately after.

```
"create a flask app"  →  Brain starts working
"what's 5 times 5"   →  queued while Brain works
                         answered immediately after first command finishes
```

Commands are processed one at a time in order — no commands are dropped.

---

## Dynamic Context Windows

Mistral's context window scales automatically based on command complexity:

| Command Type | ctx | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Simple (≤10 words) | 1024 | "create a file called hello.txt" |
| Medium (≤20 words) | 2048 | "create a folder called projects" |
| Code task (≤15 words) | 4096 | "create a flask file with routes" |
| Complex code (>15 words) | 8192 | "create a flask backend with auth and database models" |
| Complex multi-step | 4096 | long commands with and/then/also |

---

## Noise Floor Calibration

Atlas automatically calibrates microphone thresholds at startup and every 20 seconds:

- Uses the **95th percentile** of samples — handles AC/fan spikes better than mean
- Dynamically sets `start_threshold` and `stop_threshold` based on your environment
- Prints results: `[Ears] Noise floor=1842 start=7368 stop=3684`
- Warns if noise floor exceeds 5000 RMS and uses conservative static thresholds
- Stream lock prevents concurrent calibration and listening from causing ALSA crashes

**Tip:** A headset or USB microphone dramatically improves accuracy in noisy environments.

---

## Plan → Confirm → Execute

For any command that involves executing steps, Atlas will:

1. **Speak the plan** — "Creating flask folder with backend.py inside."
2. **Ask for confirmation** — "Shall I proceed, sir?"
3. **Wait for your response** — say yes/yeah/do it/go ahead to confirm, anything else cancels
4. **Execute** — runs each step, updates GUI caption with live progress, checks for cancel between steps
5. **Report** — "Done, sir. Code written to workspace/backend.py"

**File exists?** Atlas says "backend.py already exists, sir. Say overwrite to replace it." Say overwrite/replace/yes to proceed or anything else to keep the existing file.

**Slow response?** If Brain takes more than 5 seconds, Atlas says "One moment please, sir." and continues working.

## Troubleshooting

**Atlas mishears commands**
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- For file extensions say "dot p y" not "dot py"
- Consider upgrading Whisper model from `small` to `medium` in config
- A headset mic dramatically reduces background noise issues

**"Max speech duration reached" constantly firing**
- Background noise exceeds your start threshold
- Check `[Ears] Noise floor=...` in logs — if above 5000, environment is very noisy
- Increase `start_multiplier` in config (default 4.0, try 5.0 or 6.0)
- A headset mic is the most reliable fix

**ALSA/SIGABRT/SIGSEGV crashes**
- Stream accessed concurrently — ensure `_stream_lock` is in place in ears.py
- Disable `auto_calibrate` temporarily to confirm it's the source
- Restart audio: `systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber`

**Mic not found after audio crash**
- Run: `systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber`
- ears.py falls back to `pulse` device automatically if analog mic isn't found

**Response is very slow**
- Expected on CPU — 7B models take 20-30 seconds without GPU
- Simple questions via phi3 should be 2-4 seconds
- Code generation via DeepSeek takes 30-90 seconds on CPU
- GPU upgrade (sm_61+) is the most impactful hardware improvement

**phi3 trying to handle computer tasks itself**
- ESCALATE keyword triggers fallthrough to Mistral
- Code block detector in `quick_answer()` catches most cases
- Add examples to phi3 system prompt for edge cases

**File created with explanation text instead of code**
- DeepSeek added commentary — the stripper handles this automatically
- Explanation lines are commented out at bottom of file, not deleted
- Check `[ToolExecutor] ⚠️ Stripped N lines` in logs

**Mistral returning truncated JSON**
- Dynamic ctx sizing handles this automatically
- Check `[Brain] num_ctx:` log line
- If still occurring, increase manually in config

**"Shall I proceed" confirmation not heard**
- Ears resumes after TTS — speak clearly after Atlas finishes asking
- If misheard, it will cancel — just repeat the command or type yes in text box and click send

**GUI window position not saving**
- Position save/restore only works on X11 — not supported under Wayland by design
- On COSMIC desktop: right-click titlebar → Sticky to pin the window

**GUI loads in the middle of the screen**
- Expected on Wayland — compositor controls window placement
- Drag to preferred position and use compositor sticky/pin feature

## Privacy

- All processing is **local by default** — nothing leaves your machine
- Cloud API calls (Claude, Gemini) are **disabled by default**
- When enabled, Atlas **asks permission before every API call**
- Anthropic and Google do not use API calls to train their models by default
