### Stretch Goals
Multiple nodes
    3 Nodes setup
    1 - Brain - AI decisions - Primary Computer
    2 - Work Station - Handle AI decisions/commands - Secondary Computer
    3 - Peripherals - Remote use - Cellphone
        a. Add-ons such as cameras, temperature gauge, 

### Use Case
Using cellphone, fire up app. 
Say build me a python project that prints hello world.
Cell phone sends request to Primary Computer.
Primary computer creates a plan and sends back to the cell phone for user review. 
Cell phone either speaks plan aloud, or shows in text. (Depending on preference)
User confirms plan. Says build it.
Cell phone sends plan accepted message to Primary Computer.
Primary Computer sends plan to work station.
Work station opens Pycharm, creates project. Sends screenshot to cell phone.
User views screenshot on cellphone then says run it.
Project runs on secondary computer. (Reduces load on primary computer, periphals, monitor, etc - Primary computer free to function as normal without interference.)
