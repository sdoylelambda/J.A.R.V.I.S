# Jarvis Feature Priority Roadmap
### Scored by Reward ÷ Time (highest first)

> **Reward** = resume value + daily usefulness + impressiveness  
> **Time** = realistic build time for this codebase  
> **Score** = Reward (1-10) ÷ Time (1-10) — higher is better

## 🔴 Do First — Highest ROI

| # | Feature | Reward | Time | Score | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | **Fix first word cutoff** | 8 | 1 | 8.0 | Already diagnosed — VAD pre-buffer fix. Makes every interaction better. |
| 2 | **Fix broken tests** | 7 | 1 | 7.0 | Audit + mock STT/TTS. Unlocks CI/CD later. |
| 3 | **Rename repo + GPL v3 license** | 6 | 1 | 6.0 | 20 minutes. Protects the project before going public. |
| 4 | **Wake word (openWakeWord)** | 9 | 2 | 4.5 | Transforms daily usability. No more always-on STT. Huge demo moment. |
| 5 | **"What can you do?" response** | 5 | 1 | 5.0 | Hardcoded response. 1 hour. Makes demo look polished. |

## 🟡 High Value — Build Next

| # | Feature | Reward | Time | Score | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|------|-------|-------|
| 6 | **Google Calendar API** | 8 | 2 | 4.0 | "What do I have today?" is the #1 daily use case. Direct API, no browser needed. |
| 7 | **Gmail read + send** | 8 | 2 | 4.0 | Pairs naturally with calendar. Shows real workflow automation. |
| 8 | **Memory / ChromaDB** | 9 | 3 | 3.0 | Follow-up questions, context retention. Biggest single leap in intelligence. High resume value. |
| 9 | **Multi-command stack** | 7 | 2 | 3.5 | "Play music, create a file, remind me in 20 minutes." Impressive demo, moderate build. |
| 10 | **Read file** | 6 | 1 | 6.0 | "Read notes.txt" → summarize. Already has file write, read is trivial to add. |
| 11 | **Screenshot → analyze** | 8 | 2 | 4.0 | Capture screen → vision model → "here's the error and fix." Extremely impressive live. |
| 12 | **n8n integration** | 7 | 2 | 3.5 | Webhook trigger. Unlocks 400+ integrations for free. Automates complex workflows. |

## 🟢 Strong Features — Medium Term

| # | Feature | Reward | Time | Score | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|------|-------|-------|
| 13 | **Multi-model routing (classifier)** | 8 | 3 | 2.7 | Rule-based first, then LLM classifier. Resume gold — shows orchestration architecture. |
| 14 | **Context-aware projects** | 8 | 3 | 2.7 | "Create project GSX-R" → all commands scope to it. Needs memory first. |
| 15 | **Research {topic} → MD + audio** | 7 | 2 | 3.5 | Scrape → generate MD → speak summary. Already partially built. |
| 16 | **Send text via Twilio** | 6 | 2 | 3.0 | Simple API. Good demo. Pairs with Gmail. |
| 17 | **Slack alerts** | 6 | 2 | 3.0 | Webhook-based. Easy to add. Good for productivity angle. |
| 18 | **YouTube keyboard shortcuts** | 5 | 1 | 5.0 | pause/play/skip/mute via keyboard — 2 hours, makes YouTube control feel complete. |
| 19 | **Config Linux/Mac/Windows** | 6 | 2 | 3.0 | Platform utils layer. Needed before any public release. |
| 20 | **Top-level debug flag** | 4 | 1 | 4.0 | `--debug` CLI flag. Already have per-file debug, just needs global toggle. |

## 🔵 Big Swings — Later

| # | Feature | Reward | Time | Score | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|------|-------|-------|
| 21 | **VSCode voice plugin** | 9 | 5 | 1.8 | "Line 43, create a function that does X." Developer tooling + LLM = very hot combo. |
| 22 | **FastAPI WebSocket server** | 8 | 3 | 2.7 | Wraps existing app. Enables mobile. Mostly additive, minimal refactor. |
| 23 | **Create image (DALL-E/SD)** | 6 | 2 | 3.0 | "Create an image of X" → save locally. Simple API call. |
| 24 | **Analyze PDF/document** | 7 | 2 | 3.5 | Upload to Claude API with doc context. Return synopsis. |
| 25 | **Flutter mobile app** | 9 | 8 | 1.1 | Best animation, best long term. Needs FastAPI server first. Save for last. |
